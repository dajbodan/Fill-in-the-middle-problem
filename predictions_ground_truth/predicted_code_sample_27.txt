It should be a little more aberley 
--minimize gray(string1)
and so onusername_0: @username_2 I concur with that. The aberley syntax is cleaner. We won't have to deal with this nightmare once we are in the right CPA library. @username_1 as I said before, can you add this to the list of 3 momentum topics?username_1: done @username_0<issue_closed
